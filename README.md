<h3>3D Models for SparkFun Products!</h3>("3D ALL the things!")

As 3D printers proliferate, it will become increasingly handy to have 3D models of SparkFun products for your use in easily 3D printing enclosures and other mechanical parts for your projects.

We're designing a process in-house to get the important stuff modeled, but we are few and the products are many. If you have a model to contribute, please send us a pull request! 

When posting a 3D model for a product, the file type should be:

    STL (Stereolithography) or SKP (SketchUp)
    
    Scaling at 1000x life size

    Created using Eagle Up, CREO, or any program that can output STL and/or SKP

You don't need to provide both formats: either one is fine. We can smooth STL files into SKPs and vice versa. Also, if your source file is a different format, push that to us as well. Having the file in its native format may allow other users to improve your model down the line.

The repo is organized in the same way as the product catalog. If you don't know where a model goes, look at where the product is on the site. 

Before you start working on a new model, check the “bare components” folder in the repo. We’re putting together some basic component models for generic ICs, capacitors, etc. which will help all of our models look uniform and also save us all a lot of time. If you end up having to model a component, send that to us too!

Filenames will be based on the product name (as shown in the catalog) and the SKU:

    Thing Name SKU.skp

    ex: OpenSegment Serial Display - 20mm COM-11644.skp

    ex: Si4707 Weather Band Receiver Breakout WRL-11129.stl

    Revision ex: Si4707 Weather Band Receiver Breakout WRL-11544.stl
